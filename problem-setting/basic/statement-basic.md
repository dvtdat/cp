Given an array of integer, what is the largest even integer available in the array?

The first line contains an integer $ n $ $(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5)$, the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ $(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9)$, the elements of the array.

Print the largest even integer available in the array. If there is no even integer in the array, print $ -1 $.
